📌 Spam SMS Detection using Machine Learning & NLP

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to detect spam SMS messages.
It includes complete preprocessing, vectorization, model training, prediction, and model saving/loading.

🚀 Tech Stack

    Python
    Scikit-Learn
    NLTK
    Pandas
    TF-IDF Vectorization
    SVM Classifier

📊 Project Features

    ✔ Text cleaning (lowercase, stopwords removal, punctuation removal)
    ✔ TF-IDF vectorization
    ✔ SVM classification
    ✔ Saved model using pickle
    ✔ Real-time prediction script (test.ipynb)
    ✔ Jupyter notebook with full code

🧠 How It Works

    Preprocess text
    Convert to numerical features using TF-IDF
    Train SVM classifier
    Save TF-IDF model + SVM model
    Load models to make predictions
